# Student Data Setup

## Instructions

Create a file named `studentData.js` in this directory with the following content:

```javascript
// Paste the STUDENT_DATA array here (the data you provided)
const STUDENT_DATA = [
  // Your student objects...
];

module.exports = STUDENT_DATA;
```

This file is NOT tracked in git (see .gitignore) to keep the repository clean.
The seeding script will read this file automatically.
